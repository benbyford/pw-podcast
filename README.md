# pw-podcast

Simple site profile for http://processwire.com to create a podcast website that can connect with itunes.

## Install

Upload Processwire files to your hosting, add the site-pw-podcast folder to your files and navigate to the domain in your web browser. Follow the installation process and select PW Podcast from the profile select menu.

## Using the Profile

This profile can be used like any other PW site but to add you podcasts you'll need to do two things.

1. add a new child of episodes as a podcast template and fill in the information
2. add a new child of your newly created podcast and add your mp3 - this is so you can track the number of downloads (or visits) to this specific mp3 page which gives you a small amount of stats to play with; itunes don't give you stats on your podcast, so you're need any amount that will help)
3. add your rss url to itunes through their connect site https://podcastsconnect.apple.com/ and your live!
